Rejuvia does not cause cavities or any harm to your teeth (there is a minuscule amount of natural sugar in Rejuvia).

You might notice slightly better results over time if you are consistent with Rejuvia and create a strong routine around it."

For some, consistent use over 5-7 days is all it takes to experience significant improvements in their sleep. Since everyone's body responds uniquely, results may vary, but our spray is designed to help you achieve better sleep quickly and effectively."
