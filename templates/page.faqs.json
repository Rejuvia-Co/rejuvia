You should use your sleep capsules 30-45 minutes before bed and our sleep spray only 15-20 minutes before bed. \n\nAdditionally, our sleep softgels contains a slightly different, but more potent sleep formula. We have many customers who use both our sleep spray and our sleep softgels for sleep support at night. We suggest using one sleep softgel and 6-8 spritzes of your Rejuvia for extra strong sleep support at night."
